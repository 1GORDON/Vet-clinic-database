## Vet Clinic Database

In this project, I acheived the following.
- Created table owners.
- Created table species.
- Modified animals table.
- Inserted data into owners table.
- Inserted data into species table.
- Modified the inserted animals so it includes the species_id value.
- Modified the inserted animals to include owner information (owner_id).
- Updated the queries.sql file using JOIN.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
